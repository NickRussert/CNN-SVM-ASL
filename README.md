# CNN-SVM-ASL
Project using CNN and SVM to predict the correct fingerspelling letter of the ASL alphabet from images using techniques such as HOG and PCA.

# Paper
Please read paper.pdf for reference of the models used in this project.

# Dataset
This project uses the following dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

# Usage
The code requires the above dataset to be extracted into this folder, such that a training image would be: "REPO/dataset/asl_alphabet_train/asl_alphabet_train/A/A1.jpg"

Then, export_images.py should be used to create a pickle of all the images for faster loading in the real scripts.
